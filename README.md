# El-Caribeno

_A website created by: Jens, Ann, Erick, Victor and Emma._

## What is El-Caribeno
**We are creating a website for (the fictional) El Caribeño  - a caribean style hotel in Curaçao.**

### Why this project?
The hotel has recently opened and they have hired a development team to represent the beauty of their new hotel online. The scope of the project is that it is using 5 pages to represent the hotel and what it offers to customers
* as this is a development group of 5 people we are using GitHub to collaborate.

We have decided to use this template: https://colorlib.com/wp/template/marimar/
